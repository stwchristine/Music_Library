# Music_Library
This is my final project in Stanford Code in Place 2025

## Description 
Music has always had an exceptional way of brightening our days, calming anxiety and even giving us an extra boost of motivation. Sometimes, though, it can take hours to find the right song—only to come up empty-handed.

That's where a Music Library comes in! It's an interactive place for you to explore and discover new music tailored to your mood and preferences—maybe you’ll even find your next favorite song. Let's get ready to venture in this Music Library and uncover the next musical hidden gem!
