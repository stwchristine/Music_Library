This is my console project in Stanford Code in Place 2025.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The code can only be runned in the Code in Place 2025 terminal due to its link to OpenAI. 

## Purpose of the project
Music has always had an exceptional way of brightening our days, calming anxiety and even giving us an extra boost of motivation. Sometimes, though, it can take hours to find the right song—only to come up empty-handed. 

That's where a Music Library comes in! It's an interactive place for you to explore and discover new music tailored to your mood and preferences—maybe you’ll even find your next favorite song. **You will be asked seven short questions, and music library will help craft your unique prompt for the OpenAI to generate the answer.** Let's get ready to venture in this Music Library and uncover the next musical hidden gem!

I recommend the song ** “小幸运” (A Little Happiness)** by Hebe Tien (田馥甄). Released in 2015, it has garnered millions of views on
YouTube and is known for its beautiful orchestral arrangements that create a nostalgic and relaxing atmosphere. The song captures
feelings of reminiscence and is perfect for your purpose of relaxation. Although it was released slightly over five years ago, it
continues to resonate with listeners and fits your criteria for a soothing Mandarin pop song. Enjoy!

Do you want to know any fun facts about the chosen song?
[yes]

A fun fact about ** “小幸运” (A Little Happiness)** by Hebe Tien is that it was featured in the Taiwanese film **"Our Times"
(我的少女时代)**, which became a massive hit in Taiwan and across Asia. The song's themes of nostalgia and youthful love perfectly
complement the movie's storyline, helping to establish it as an anthem for those reflecting on their own adolescent experiences.
The song's emotional depth and beautiful melody have contributed to its lasting popularity making it a memorable piece in the
landscape of Mandarin pop music. Enjoy listening!
